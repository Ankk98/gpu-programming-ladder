# GPU Programming Ladder

A progressive, interactive learning path for mastering modern GPU programming and optimization, from CUDA basics to FlashAttention, LLM kernels, and generative AI applications across text, image, audio, and video modalities.

## 🎯 Overview

This project provides a structured curriculum for learning GPU programming, designed as an interactive checklist that guides you through:

- **Phase 1**: GPU Architecture & Parallelism Foundations
- **Phase 2**: Core Kernels (Maps, Reductions, Scans & MatMul)
- **Phase 3**: PyTorch & Custom Kernels
- **Phase 4**: Triton, Kernel Fusion & torch.compile
- **Phase 5**: LLM & Modern GPU Concepts (FlashAttention, KV Cache, Quantization)
- **Phase 6**: Distributed, Multi-GPU & Advanced Topics
- **Phase 7**: Generative AI Applications (Text, Image, Audio, Video Generation, GPU Optimizations, Serving & Deployment)

Each phase includes curated learning resources (articles, videos, exercises) and tracks your progress locally in your browser.
